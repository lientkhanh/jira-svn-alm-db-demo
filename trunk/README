This is an example to show hot to import a  database connection from the Subversion ALM add-on for JIRA.

WARNING!: It's built upon the old JIRA 4.x API. Even it will work on JIRA 5+,
use please a newer JIRA API version by following the steps below:

1. Add a copy in your plugin of this class:

	com.kintosoft.svnwebclient.jira.public_interface.SWCPublicInterface

2. Import the the implementation by add-in the following element into your atlassian-plugin.xml descriptor:

	<component-import key="svnalm-public">
		<interface>com.kintosoft.svnwebclient.jira.public_interface.SWCPublicInterface
		</interface>
	</component-import>

3. Use injection in the constructor to get an instance of the object similarly to:

com.kintosoft.jira.svn.demo.SubversionALMDemoProjectTabPanel

4. Get a JDBC connection and do not forget make a commit/rollabak and close the connection in
order to return it to the pool. See the SubversionALMDemoProjectTabPanel.getHtml() method.

Enjoy.
